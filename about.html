      <h1>History of PLAI</h1>
      <p>
        The Philippine Library Association (PLAI) traces its beginnings to the early
        1920s, when Filipino librarians recognized the need for professional
        collaboration and the development of library services in the country.

        <p>
          Between 1920 and 1923, a group of six professional librarians returned to the
          Philippines from the United States where they received training in library
          science as government scholarship grantees. They were Gabriel A. Bernardo,
          Eulogio Rodriguez, Jose Munda, and Cirilo B. Perez from the Wisconsin Library
          School; Isaac V. Lucero from the University of Illinois; and Isidoro Saniel
          from the New York State Library School.

          Recognizing the growing importance of popular libraries and the need for an
          exchange of professional ideas, these librarians approached Dr. Trinidad H.
          Pardo de Tavera, then Director of the Philippine Library and Museum, and
          proposed the establishment of a library association.

          On October 22, 1923, Director Tavera convened a conference of librarians and
          other individuals interested in organizing an association of libraries.
          This gathering marked the birth of the Philippine Library Association.
          A committee was immediately appointed to draft the association’s constitution
          and by-laws, which were later approved.

          During the same meeting, the first set of officers was elected. Dr. Trinidad
          H. Pardo de Tavera, a statesman, scholar, and bibliographer, was unanimously
          elected President. Mr. Jose Zurbito became Vice-President, while Mr. Cirilo
          B. Perez and Mrs. Rosa Abriol were elected Secretary and Treasurer,
          respectively.

          Of the thirty-three charter members, five were Americans while the rest were
          Filipino library staff members. At the time, library resources in Manila
          were limited and largely unorganized, consisting mainly of government,
          private, and school libraries with restricted access to readers.
